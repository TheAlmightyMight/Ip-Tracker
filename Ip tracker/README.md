# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

<h1>This is my IP-TRACKER that uses two different APIs to get information about a current user's location.</h1>

<p>You can search <bold> IP addresses and domains </bold> with it. It also stores the inforamtion about the initial location in local storage and has a cool-looking map made with 
  <strong> Leaflet.JS </strong> in order to display it.</p>
