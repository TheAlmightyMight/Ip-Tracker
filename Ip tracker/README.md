# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my IP-TRACKER that uses two different APIs to get information where a current user is located.

You can search IP addresses and domains with it. It also stores the inforamtion about your location in local storage and has a cool-looking map made with 

Leaflet.JS to show your loaction.
