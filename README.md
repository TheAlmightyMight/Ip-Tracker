<h1> Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker </h1>

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./ip-tracker/images/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

<h2>## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<h3>This is my IP-TRACKER that uses two different APIs to get information about a current user's location.</h3>

<p> <p>You can search <b> IP addresses and domains </b> with it. It also stores the inforamtion about 
the initial location of a user in a local storage and has a cool-looking map made with 
<strong> Leaflet.JS </strong> in order to display it.</p>

</b> This is a Vanilla JavaScript App! <b>
